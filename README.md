# Opal

Welcome to Opal proxy, a fully featured and sleek Ultraviolet implementation.
this entire project was made over the span of 3 days, 2 if you don't include
making a figma and initial commit.

This is my entree the the 2024 proxathon, mostly because I wanted to make
something in this style already, and the proxathon seems like a fun idea
